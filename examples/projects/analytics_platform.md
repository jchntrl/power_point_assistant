# Real-time Analytics Platform

## Project Overview
Build comprehensive real-time analytics platform for processing IoT sensor data from manufacturing equipment to provide actionable insights and predictive maintenance capabilities.

## Client Requirements
- Process 1M+ sensor readings per minute
- Real-time dashboard for equipment monitoring
- Predictive maintenance algorithms
- Historical data analysis and reporting
- Multi-tenant architecture for different facilities
- Integration with existing ERP systems

## Technical Scope
- **Data Ingestion**: Apache Kafka for streaming data ingestion
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Spark Streaming for real-time analysis
- **Data Storage**: 
  - Time-series database (InfluxDB) for sensor data
  - Data lake (Azure Data Lake) for historical analysis
  - PostgreSQL for metadata and configuration
- **Analytics Engine**: Python with scikit-learn for ML models
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- **API Layer**: FastAPI for REST endpoints
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow for batch processing workflows

## Expected Diagrams
This project should generate:
1. **Data Pipeline Architecture**: Showing data flow from IoT sensors through Kafka, Spark, to storage and visualization
2. **Cloud Architecture Diagram**: Illustrating Azure services, networking, and security components
